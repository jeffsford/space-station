    MARS<hr/>
  If the sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth would be the size of a nickel, and Mars would be about as big as an aspirin tablet.<hr/>
  Several missions have visited this planet, from flybys and orbiters to rovers on the surface of the Red Planet. The first true Mars mission success was Mariner 4 in 1965.<hr/>
  Mars is known as the Red Planet because iron minerals in the Martian soil
  oxidize, or rust, causing the soil -- and the dusty atmosphere -- to look red.
